## Installation and Setup

Run `yarn install` from the root and finally `yarn start` to run the dev server and compile the application.

Tests can be run with `yarn test`. I've used Snapshot tests which were quick to implement with high coverage, with `enzyme` shallow rendering to confine them to units.
